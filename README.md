### üõ† Functional Overview

In this project, you will learn to build a complete web application, implementing a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) system for a **Purchase Order Management System**.

### üß™ Test Coverage

For the tests, the parameters are passed to the API via the **application.properties** file. The tests were created to cover the main functionalities of the project, such as:

- Creating tables in the in-memory **H2** database.
- Executing the following features:
  - Creating two sellers.
  - Updating one seller.
  - Creating two customers.
  - Updating one customer.
  - Creating two **Purchase Orders (PO)**.
  - Deleting one seller.
  - Deleting one customer.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Information

#### POST - CPF Validation
- Validates the CPF according to Brazilian rules.
- Checks if the CPF already exists in the database to avoid duplicating a customer.

#### PUT - CPF Validation
- Performs validation in case the document being updated is the same as in the POST. If attempting to change to an already existing CPF, it informs that the CPF is already registered.

#### DELETE - Customer Deletion
- Checks if the customer has any **Purchase Orders (PO)**. If they do, deletion is not allowed.

### üìÑ PO (Purchase Order)
#### Additional Information:
- **POST**: Uses an **enum** type for priority and status.
- Seller and customer are linked by their IDs as the tables are related.

#### PUT - Update PO
- Example of passing only the body. In the case of the customer, it was being mentioned as a parameter in the URL, but here the ID is inside the body.

### üõí Sellers

#### PUT - CPF Validation
- Validates the CPF according to Brazilian rules.
- Checks if the CPF already exists in the database to avoid duplicating a seller.

#### POST - Seller Update
- Receives the ID as a parameter and the body contains the information to be updated.
- If an invalid or already registered CPF is provided, the system informs that the CPF cannot be changed.

#### DELETE - Seller Deletion
- Checks if the seller has any **Purchase Orders (PO)** linked to their ID. If they do, deletion is not allowed.
